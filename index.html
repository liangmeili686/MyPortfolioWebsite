                    <p>Have you ever been moved by a song from a movie you love?
                        Great! This Chrome extension helps you find the theme song 
                        (or the most iconic song) from the movie you're watching and 
                        automatically add it to your Spotify playlist — saving you 
                        the trouble of searching for it manually.
                        <br><br>
                        All you have to do is authorize the extension to access your 
                        Spotify account (via API), and then just enjoy the movie!
                        <br><br>
                        When the movie is nearing the end — specifically, when only 
                        five minutes remain — a window will pop up asking if you'd 
                        like to add the theme song to your playlist. The song title 
                        will be shown so you can confirm it's the one you like. The 
                        extension also keeps track of movies you've already added songs 
                        from, so it won't ask you again.
                        <br><br>
                        Current limitation:
                        The extension currently only works with YouTube TV, as it needs 
                        to detect the movie title on the page in order to search for 
                        the correct song. Since different video platforms use different 
                        HTML structures, the extension has only been configured to work 
                        with YouTube TV for now.

                        This scrolling side game challenges players to survive as long as 
                        they can against the flying and bouncing enemies, with a shooting 
                        mode controlled by mouse. It is based from a story I wrote. Each 
                        enemy represents a specific symbol-hearts for love, and eyes for 
                        appearance. Feel free to check out the story behind!
                        <br><br>
                        I used object-oriented programming extensively to organize the enemy 
                        classes. This helped create randomly generated looping events that 
                        allow the game to scroll infinitely. As I enjoyed building the game, 
                        my frontend skills improved significantly through the use of complex 
                        conditional logic and events handling.
                        <br><br>
                        Current limitation:
                        The game may lack innovative gameplay and is not yet attractive enough
                        to hold a player's attention for long. It definitely needs more development
                        time to be mature. I'm currently considering integrating this demo into 
                        a larger RPG that tells the full story-not just a summary!
